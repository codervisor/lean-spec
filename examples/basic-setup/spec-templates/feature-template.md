# [Feature Name]

> **Quick Reference**: [One-sentence description of what this feature does]

## Goal (Why)

[Explain why this feature exists. What problem does it solve? What value does it deliver to users or the business?]

**Success Metric**: [How will you measure if this feature achieves its goal?]

---

## Key Scenarios

### Scenario 1: [Primary Happy Path]

**As a** [user type]  
**I want to** [action]  
**So that** [benefit]

**Steps**:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Expected outcome]

### Scenario 2: [Secondary Important Case]

**As a** [user type]  
**I want to** [action]  
**So that** [benefit]

**Steps**:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Expected outcome]

### Scenario 3: [Edge Case or Error Handling]

[Describe important edge cases or error scenarios that must work correctly]

## Technical Contracts

### APIs / Interfaces

```
[API endpoint or function signature]
Input: [what goes in]
Output: [what comes out]
Errors: [what can go wrong]
```

### Data Models

```
[Key data structures or schemas]
```

### Dependencies

## Non-Goals

[What are we explicitly NOT doing in this phase? Be specific to prevent scope creep.]

- Not implementing [feature X] (planned for future phase)
- Not supporting [use case Y] (out of scope)
- Not optimizing for [scenario Z] (not a current priority)
