## Quick Reference

### Key Findings
- **Primary audience**: AI-First Developers (Cursor/Copilot/Aider users)
- **Best hook**: "Your specs are too big for AI to read" (context overflow pain)
- **Top weaknesses**: Buried lede, generic positioning, weak emotional hook, no social proof
- **Recommended approach**: Problem-Solution-Principles structure

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Quick wins (hero rewrite, scenarios, CTA, dogfooding stats) - 2-3 hours
2. **Phase 2**: Visual enhancement (icons, demo, formatting) - 4-5 hours
3. **Phase 3**: Social proof collection (testimonials, case studies) - ongoing
