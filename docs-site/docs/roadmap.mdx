# Roadmap

LeanSpec is actively developed. Here's what's coming next—with links to the actual specs we're using to build them. (We dogfood LeanSpec!)

## In Development (v0.2.0)

**Official Launch** - Establishing LeanSpec as production-ready
- Rock-solid stability and comprehensive documentation
- Practice what we preach: demonstrate first principles through implementation
- Operationalize principles with validation and complexity checks
- [View spec 043](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/043-official-launch-02)

## Planned Near-Term (v0.3.0+)

**VS Code Extension** - Native IDE integration
- Inline spec management without leaving your editor
- Tree view with status indicators and quick actions
- Frontmatter validation and autocomplete
- Integration with GitHub Copilot context
- [View spec 017](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/017-vscode-extension)

**GitHub Action** - Automate spec workflows in CI/CD
- Validate specs in pull requests
- Block PRs if planned specs aren't complete
- Auto-generate spec summaries in PR comments
- Track spec completion metrics over time
- [View spec 016](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/016-github-action)

**Copilot Chat Integration** - Interact with specs through AI chat
- Slash commands for spec operations directly in Copilot Chat
- Natural language spec queries and creation
- Seamless AI-powered spec management
- [View spec 034](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/034-copilot-slash-commands)

## Planned Long-Term

**PM System Integrations** - Connect with existing workflows
- Bidirectional sync with GitHub Issues, Jira, and Azure DevOps
- LeanSpec as source of truth for specs, PM systems for tracking
- Maintain existing workflows while adding spec-driven clarity
- [View spec 036](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/036-pm-integrations)

**Tool Redesign** - Evolving the architecture
- First-principles rethinking of CLI and MCP design
- Improved performance and extensibility
- Enhanced developer experience
- [View spec 050](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/050-tool-redesign-first-principles)

## Completed

**v0.1.0** - Alpha Release
- Core CLI with spec management
- MCP server for AI integration
- Templates and custom fields
