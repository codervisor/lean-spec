# Built-in Metadata

LeanSpec specs store a small set of system-managed fields in frontmatter so humans, dashboards, and AI agents share the same truth. Keep these fields accurate—automation, Kanban boards, and MCP-powered workflows all rely on them.

## Status Lifecycle
1. **planned** — intent captured, implementation not started.
2. **in-progress** — work is actively happening.
3. **blocked** — external dependency is preventing progress.
4. **complete** — implementation finished and validated.
5. **archived** — historical reference only.

Update status the moment implementation starts or stops; status tracks the work, not the spec writing process. Use `lean-spec update <spec> --status <value>` so every tool (and AI agent) sees the same state.

## Relationships
LeanSpec uses **`depends_on`** to capture blocking dependencies:

- **`depends_on`** — Directional dependency. Spec A cannot start until Spec B is complete.
  ```yaml
  depends_on:
    - 082
  ```
  Appears as **→** in `lean-spec deps` and automatically adds a "Required By" entry on the dependency.

Use `depends_on` when work truly must be done in a specific order. For loosely related specs that share context but don't block each other, document the relationship in the spec content instead.

## Priority & Tags
These fields make specs filterable and keep planning lightweight.

- **priority** communicates urgency or impact. Typical values: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`.
- **tags** provide fast slicing across the portfolio. Stick to a shared vocabulary (for example `frontend`, `backend`, `docs`, `infra`).
  ```yaml
  priority: high
  tags: [api, backend, security]
  ```

Aim for 2-4 tags per spec. Too many tags reduce signal and make search noisy.

## Example Frontmatter
```yaml
---
status: in-progress
priority: high
tags: [api, backend]
depends_on: [082]
created: '2025-11-16'
---
```

## Why Metadata Discipline Matters
- **Projects stay honest** — Boards, burndown charts, and roadmap exports use these fields directly.
- **AI stays aligned** — Agents decide whether to edit a spec or start implementation based on `status`, `priority`, and dependencies.
- **Context sharing improves** — Tags, relationships, and status transitions tell newcomers where to plug in without another meeting.

Treat the frontmatter like code: update it as soon as reality changes and validate with `lean-spec validate` before merging.
