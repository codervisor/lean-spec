LeanSpec 0.2.10 brings a more interactive web experience with inline metadata editing, zero-config MCP setup during initialization, and significant improvements to multi-project management. This release focuses on reducing friction—whether you're managing specs in the browser, setting up AI agent integrations, or working across multiple projects.

**Highlights**: Edit spec metadata directly in the browser, automatic MCP configuration for your AI tools, bootstrap mode for legacy specs, and polished multi-project workflows.

## ✏️ Inline Metadata Editing in Web UI

No more switching between the web interface and command line to update spec metadata. You can now edit everything directly in the browser:

![Inline metadata editing in spec detail view](/img/blog/v0210/inline-metadata-editing.png)

### What You Can Edit

- **Status** - Click the status badge to change between planned, in-progress, complete, and archived
- **Priority** - Update priority levels (low, medium, high, critical) with a single click
- **Tags** - Add, remove, and search tags with autocomplete suggestions
- **Dependencies** - Manage `depends_on` relationships without leaving the spec view

### How It Works

Changes are **optimistic**—the UI updates immediately while the save happens in the background. If something fails, changes roll back automatically with a clear error message.

This works in both filesystem mode (local development) and multi-project mode (team dashboards).

```bash
# Launch the web UI
lean-spec ui

# Or with a custom port
lean-spec ui --port 3001
```

Open any spec, and you'll see the editable metadata panel on the right side.

## 🔧 MCP Auto-Setup During Init

Setting up MCP server integration used to require manual configuration. Now `lean-spec init` handles it automatically.

### Automatic Detection

When you run `lean-spec init`, LeanSpec detects your AI tools and offers to configure MCP:

```bash
$ lean-spec init

✔ Detected AI tools: Claude Code, VS Code, Cursor

? Configure MCP server for detected tools? (Y/n) y

✔ Created .mcp.json for Claude Code
✔ Created .vscode/mcp.json for VS Code  
✔ Created .cursor/mcp.json for Cursor
```

### Zero Manual Config

Each configuration file gets the correct format with absolute paths:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lean-spec": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@leanspec/mcp"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/your/project"
    }
  }
}
```

Your AI agents can immediately access LeanSpec tools—no copy-paste from docs, no path troubleshooting.

### Supported Tools

- **Claude Code** - `.mcp.json`
- **VS Code** - `.vscode/mcp.json`
- **Cursor** - `.cursor/mcp.json`

More tools coming soon based on demand.

## 🔄 Bootstrap Mode for Legacy Specs

Migrating existing specs that lack frontmatter? The new `--bootstrap` flag makes it painless:

```bash
# Create frontmatter for specs that don't have any
lean-spec backfill --bootstrap
```

### What Bootstrap Does

1. **Scans for missing frontmatter** - Identifies specs without YAML metadata
2. **Infers status from git history** - Uses commit patterns to guess current state
3. **Sets created date from first commit** - Accurate timestamps from your git log
4. **Handles legacy formats** - Recognizes ADR, RFC, and inline metadata patterns

### Legacy Format Support

Bootstrap understands common documentation patterns:

- **ADR status lines**: `Status: Accepted` → `status: complete`
- **RFC headers**: `Status: Proposed` → `status: planned`
- **Inline metadata**: `**Status**: Complete` → `status: complete`

```bash
# Preview what would change
lean-spec backfill --bootstrap --dry-run

# Apply changes
lean-spec backfill --bootstrap
```

## 📁 Multi-Project Management Polish

For teams managing multiple projects through the web UI, we've made several improvements:

### Quick Access to Project Management

The project switcher dropdown now includes a "Manage Projects" option—no more hunting for the projects page.

### Inline Project Editing

Edit project names and colors directly on the `/projects` page. Click a project name to rename it, or use the color picker to customize the visual indicator.

### Better Path Handling

- Long paths no longer overflow the Add Project dialog
- Path validation shows clear status (valid/invalid/missing)
- Invalid paths are highlighted before you try to save

### Smarter Navigation

When you switch projects from a spec detail page, you're now redirected to that project's spec list instead of getting a 404.

## 📊 Dependency Graph (v0.2.9 Bonus)

If you missed it in the previous release, the new `/dependencies` page gives you a bird's-eye view of your entire project's dependency structure:

![Project-wide dependency graph visualization](/img/blog/v0210/dependency-graph.png)

- **Interactive DAG layout** with zoom, pan, and mini-map navigation
- **Filter by status** - Focus on planned, in-progress, or complete specs
- **Click to navigate** - Double-click any node to open the spec detail
- **Highlight chains** - Select a spec to see its full dependency path

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Dependencies Page Works on Custom Ports

Previously, `lean-spec ui --port 3002` would break the dependencies page due to hardcoded localhost:3000 calls. Fixed—the page now works on any port.

### Multi-Project Dependencies Fixed

The "View Dependencies" button on spec detail pages now works correctly in multi-project mode with a new dedicated API endpoint.

### MCP `deps` Tool Finds Specs Correctly

The `deps` MCP tool now correctly resolves specs by sequence number (e.g., `045` finds `045-feature-name`).

### Light Theme Contrast

Dependencies page nodes are now readable in light theme. We updated the color palette for proper contrast in both themes.

## ⚡ Performance: Lighter Spec Lists

Spec list APIs no longer return full `contentMd` for each spec. For projects with many specs, this reduces initial page load size by ~90%.

Full content loads on-demand when you open a spec detail page.

## Upgrade

```bash
# Update global installation
npm install -g lean-spec@latest

# Or use npx (always gets latest)
npx lean-spec@latest board
```

If you're using the MCP server:

```bash
# Update MCP package
npm install -g @leanspec/mcp@latest
```

## What's Next

- **VS Code extension** - Native spec management in your editor
- **GitHub Action** - Automated spec validation in CI
- **More MCP tool improvements** - Based on your feedback
