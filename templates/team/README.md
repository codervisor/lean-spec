# Team Template

For small teams (2-5 people) working together on a shared codebase.

## What's Included

- **AGENTS.md** - Team coding standards and AI integration
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - How the team collaborates
- **Example spec** - Shows ownership, collaboration, review process
- **Config** - Team-friendly defaults

## Structure

```
your-project/
├── specs/
│   └── YYYYMMDD/
│       └── NNN-name/
│           └── README.md
├── AGENTS.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
└── .lspec/
    └── config.json
```

## Philosophy

Specs enable alignment. Use them for features that affect multiple people. Skip them for obvious changes.

## Next Steps

1. Customize AGENTS.md with your team's standards
2. Update CONTRIBUTING.md with your workflow
3. Review example spec with team
4. Delete example and create your first real spec
