# Contributing to [Project Name]

## Getting Started

1. Check existing specs in `specs/` for related work
2. For new features, create a spec first: `lspec create feature-name`
3. Share spec with team for feedback
4. Implement after spec approval
5. Update spec if approach changes

## Spec-Driven Development

We use LeanSpec for planning and alignment:

- **Write specs for**: New features, API changes, architecture decisions
- **Skip specs for**: Bug fixes, tiny tweaks, obvious changes
- **Update specs**: When learning something that changes the approach

## Code Review

- All PRs require 2+ approvals
- Link PRs to relevant specs
- Discuss major changes before implementation
- Be respectful and constructive
