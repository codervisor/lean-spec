# AI Agent Instructions - Team Project

## Project Overview

<!-- Brief description and team context -->

## Team Standards

### Code Style
- Follow team style guide
- <!-- e.g., TypeScript + React, functional components -->
- Run linter before committing

### Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Code review required (2+ approvals)
- CI must pass before merge

### Collaboration
- Discuss in <!-- e.g., #team-channel --> before major changes
- Tag relevant reviewers in PRs
- Update specs when implementation differs

## Working with LeanSpec

1. **Check for existing specs** - Someone may have already spec'd related work
2. **Create spec before implementation** - For features/changes affecting others
3. **Get feedback early** - Share specs for review before coding
4. **Update together** - If you change approach, update the spec
5. **Archive completed work** - Keep specs directory clean

## Spec Review Process

When creating/updating specs:
- Tag team members who should review
- Allow 24-48 hours for feedback
- Address questions before implementation
- Link PR back to spec

## Before Submitting PRs

- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code style consistent
- [ ] Spec updated (if implementation differs)
- [ ] Reviewers tagged
- [ ] CI passing

## Communication

- **Questions**: Ask in <!-- #team-channel -->
- **Urgent**: Tag @team-lead
- **Decisions**: Document in spec's Notes section
