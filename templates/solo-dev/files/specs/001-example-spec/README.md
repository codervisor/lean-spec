## Goal

This is an example spec to show you how LeanSpec works. Delete this and create your first real spec with `lspec create my-feature`.

## Key Points

- Specs are lightweight - capture just enough to communicate intent
- Each spec lives in its own folder: `specs/YYYYMMDD/NNN-name/`
- Use README.md as the main spec, add supporting files as needed
- Update specs as you learn (living documentation)

## Non-Goals

- Don't try to document every edge case upfront
- Don't write specs for trivial changes
- Don't let specs become outdated - archive or update them

## Notes

LeanSpec is a mindset, not a rigid format. Adapt this structure to your needs.

Key principles:
- **Clarity over documentation** - Write just enough
- **Essential over exhaustive** - Focus on what matters
- **Living over frozen** - Update as you learn
