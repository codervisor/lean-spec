## Project Overview

<!-- Brief description of what this project does -->

## Working with LeanSpec

1. **Read specs first** - Check `specs/` for relevant specifications
2. **Update living docs** - If implementation differs, update the spec
3. **Follow Non-Goals** - Don't implement explicitly excluded items
4. **Keep it lean** - If spec is unclear, ask rather than guess
