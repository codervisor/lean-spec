1. **Read README.md first** - Understand project context
2. **Check specs/** - Review existing specs before starting
3. **Follow LeanSpec principles** - Clarity over documentation
4. **Keep it minimal** - If it doesn't add clarity, cut it
5. **Never use nested code blocks** - Markdown doesn't support code blocks within code blocks. Use indentation or describe the structure instead
