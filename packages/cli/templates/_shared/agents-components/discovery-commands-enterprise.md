Before starting work, understand project context and dependencies:

- `lean-spec stats` - See work distribution across specs
- `lean-spec board` - View specs organized by status
- `lean-spec list --tag=<tag>` - Find specs by tag (e.g., `--tag=security`)
- `lean-spec search "<query>"` - Full-text search across specs
- `lean-spec deps <spec>` - Check dependencies before starting work
- `lean-spec gantt` - View project timeline and milestones

These commands help you understand what exists, what's in progress, and what depends on what.
