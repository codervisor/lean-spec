1. **Security first** - Follow security standards, no shortcuts
2. **Read specs/** - Check for compliance requirements
3. **Follow LeanSpec** - Lean doesn't mean skipping governance
4. **Document decisions** - Especially security and compliance choices
5. **Never use nested code blocks** - Markdown doesn't support code blocks within code blocks. Use indentation or describe the structure instead
