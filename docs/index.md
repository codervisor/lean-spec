features:
  - icon: 🎯
    title: Clarity over Documentation
    details: Write just enough to communicate intent clearly. If it doesn't add clarity, don't write it.
  
  - icon: 🚀
    title: Essential over Exhaustive
    details: Focus on the 20% of scenarios that deliver 80% of the value. Document what must work, not every edge case.
  
  - icon: 📱
    title: Living Guide over Frozen Contract
    details: Specs evolve with your project. Update them as you learn, don't treat them as immutable contracts.
  
  - icon: 🧠
    title: Reduced Mind Burden
    details: Keep specs short and scannable. The goal is to reduce cognitive load, not create reference manuals.
  
  - icon: ⚡
    title: Speed over Perfection
    details: Ship a "good enough" spec quickly. You can always refine it based on feedback and learning.
  
  - icon: 🤝
    title: AI-Powered Development
    details: Clear specs help both human developers and AI coding agents stay aligned and productive.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g lean-spec

# Initialize in your project
lspec init

# Create your first spec
lspec create my-feature

# List all specs
lspec list
```

## What is LeanSpec?

LeanSpec is a **mindset and methodology, not a rigid format or tool**. It's about capturing what truly matters with minimal overhead.

Traditional software specifications often suffer from:
- 📚 **Documentation Overload**: Lengthy documents that nobody reads or maintains
- 🔒 **Frozen Contracts**: Specs that become outdated as soon as development begins
- 🤯 **Exhaustive Overthinking**: Trying to document every possible edge case upfront
- 💭 **Mind Burden**: Cognitive load from managing verbose, complicated documentation

LeanSpec provides a **lightweight, agile approach** to specification that keeps teams—both humans and AI coding agents—focused on what truly matters.

## Perfect for AI-Powered Teams

In the era of AI-assisted development, LeanSpec serves as both a methodology and an adaptive workflow for AI-powered development teams:

- **Clear Context**: Starting with "why" gives AI agents the purpose behind the work
- **Concrete Scenarios**: Specific examples help AI understand expected behavior
- **Testable Criteria**: Clear targets guide AI implementation
- **Boundaries**: Explicit non-goals help AI avoid scope creep
- **Adaptable Structure**: Consistency helps AI parse effectively
