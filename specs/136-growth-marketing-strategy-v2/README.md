# LeanSpec Growth Marketing Strategy v2

> **Status**: 📅 Planned · **Priority**: Critical · **Created**: 2025-12-04

## Overview

Address declining traction (78 stars, 4k→1k npm downloads) with differentiated marketing strategy after initial launch attempts on HN, Reddit, V2EX, and personal channels failed to gain sustained momentum.

**Channels already tried:** WeChat, HN, Reddit, V2EX, personal blog (marvinzhang.dev), Medium, Dev.to

**Hypothesis for low traction:**
1. **Timing & Discovery** - Launched after Spec Kit, OpenSpec, Kiro already captured mindshare
2. **Differentiation gap** - Features similar enough that switching cost > perceived benefit
3. **Social proof** - Low stars/downloads create negative feedback loop
4. **Content format** - Tool announcements get lost; stories/outcomes resonate more

## Diagnosis

### Why Existing Users Don't Switch

| Barrier | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Switching cost** | High - must migrate existing specs | Emphasize migration tool, highlight 1-command migration |
| **Learning curve** | Medium - new concepts | Focus on "try for 10 minutes" messaging |
| **Uncertainty** | High - "will it be maintained?" | Show velocity (135+ specs), weekly releases |
| **Risk** | Medium - what if it breaks | Emphasize local-first, git-native (zero lock-in) |

### Why New Users Don't Start

| Barrier | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Don't know what SDD is** | Critical - category education needed | Lead with pain points, not solution |
| **Satisfied with vibe coding** | High - no felt need for specs | Target "burned by AI" moments |
| **Too many AI tools** | High - fatigue | "Works with what you have" messaging |
| **Looks like another TODO** | Medium - low urgency | Emphasize AI performance boost |

## Strategy

### Pivot: From "Tool Launch" to "Movement Building"

**Old approach (failed):** "Here's a cool tool, try it"  
**New approach:** "Here's a philosophy that works—tool is just the implementation"

### Three Pillars

**1. Content-Led Growth** (Primary)
- Educational content about AI coding pitfalls and solutions
- Not "use LeanSpec" but "here's how to think about AI-assisted dev"
- Tool discovery happens organically through credibility

**2. Integration-Led Growth** (Secondary)
- Deep integrations with AI tools people already use
- Partner content with Cursor/Windsurf/Claude communities
- "LeanSpec + [Tool X]" guides for specific workflows

**3. Community-Led Growth** (Long-term)
- Build around the "First Principles SDD" philosophy
- Contributors become evangelists
- Success stories from real projects

## Plan

### Phase 1: Video & Visual Content (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Reach audiences that don't read long-form (Medium/Dev.to already tried)

**Video content:**
- [ ] YouTube: "5-min demo: Spec-driven AI coding" (screen recording)
- [ ] YouTube Shorts / TikTok: "AI broke my code again" series (15-60s pain points)
- [ ] Loom-style walkthrough for README/docs landing page
- [ ] Cursor/Windsurf integration tutorial video

**Visual content:**
- [ ] Infographic: "Vibe Coding vs Spec-Driven" comparison
- [ ] GIF demos for Twitter/X threads
- [ ] Before/after code diff screenshots

**Distribution:**
- YouTube (searchable, evergreen)
- Twitter/X (shareable, viral potential)
- Chinese: Bilibili, Xiaohongshu (different audience than WeChat)

### Phase 2: Strategic Integrations (Weeks 3-6)

**Goal:** Capture users where they already work

- [ ] Cursor community integration guide + video
- [ ] Windsurf workflow tutorial
- [ ] Claude Desktop + LeanSpec MCP showcase
- [ ] GitHub Copilot Chat + MCP integration
- [ ] Aider workflow example

**Partnership outreach:**
- Offer to write integration guides for AI tool blogs
- Reach out to AI tool YouTubers for collaboration

### Phase 3: Social Proof Loop (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal:** Create visible momentum

- [ ] "100 Stars" milestone campaign (share what we learned)
- [ ] Collect and showcase 3-5 real user stories
- [ ] Weekly changelog highlights on Twitter
- [ ] GitHub Sponsors setup (signals commitment)
- [ ] Compare before/after: projects with/without specs

### Phase 4: Community Foundation (Weeks 7-12)

**Goal:** Build a community around the philosophy

- [ ] Discord/Slack community for "AI-assisted development"
- [ ] Monthly "Show Your Spec" showcase
- [ ] Office hours / AMA sessions
- [ ] Contributor recognition program
- [ ] "First Principles SDD" newsletter

## Differentiated Messaging

### Old Messaging (Generic)
> "LeanSpec is a lightweight SDD framework for AI-powered teams"

### New Messaging (Specific)

**For frustrated AI users:**
> "Stop re-prompting. One spec = one perfect output."

**For skeptics:**
> "Not another AI tool. It's a thinking framework that happens to be a tool."

**For teams:**
> "Your AI assistant has amnesia. Specs are its memory."

**For solo devs:**
> "Vibe coding got me 80% there. Specs got me the last 20% that actually matters."

## Distribution Channels (Revised)

### High-Value (Focus Here)
| Channel | Content Type | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **YouTube** | Tutorials, demos | Searchable, visual learners, evergreen |
| **Twitter/X** | Threads, GIFs, short videos | Developer community, shareable |
| **AI tool communities** | Integration guides | Pre-qualified users |
| **Bilibili** | Chinese tutorials | Untapped audience vs WeChat |
| **GitHub Discussions** | Q&A, showcases | SEO, community building |

### Medium-Value (Opportunistic)
| Channel | Content Type | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **HN** | Show HN (milestone stories) | High variance, but high ceiling |
| **Reddit** | Answers, not promos | Subreddit rules strict |
| **Product Hunt** | One-time launch | Time investment high |
| **Podcasts** | Guest appearances | Credibility, niche audiences |

### Already Tried (Iterate, Don't Repeat)
| Channel | What to Change |
|---------|----------------|
| **Medium/Dev.to** | Repurpose into video scripts, don't write new articles |
| **V2EX** | Deprioritize - overlap with WeChat |
| **WeChat** | Focus on group engagement, not broadcast |
| **Personal blog** | SEO backlinks only |

## Metrics

### Lead Indicators (Track Weekly)
- [ ] Content views/reads (target: 1k/week)
- [ ] GitHub profile visits (target: 100/week)
- [ ] Twitter impressions (target: 5k/week)
- [ ] Integration guide completions (target: 10/week)

### Lag Indicators (Track Monthly)
- [ ] GitHub stars (target: 200 by end of Q1)
- [ ] npm weekly downloads (target: 2k stable)
- [ ] Community members (target: 50 in Discord)
- [ ] Contributors (target: 5 external PRs)

## Test

Success criteria at 90-day checkpoint:
- [ ] 200+ GitHub stars (from 78)
- [ ] 2k+ npm weekly downloads (stable, not declining)
- [ ] 10+ integration guides published
- [ ] 5+ user testimonials collected
- [ ] 1+ external contributor PRs merged

## Notes

### What We're NOT Doing

- ❌ Paid advertising (too early, not enough signal on messaging)
- ❌ Aggressive HN/Reddit posting (diminishing returns, reputation risk)
- ❌ Feature parity race with Spec Kit/OpenSpec (lose on resources)
- ❌ Enterprise sales motions (premature)

### Key Insight

Spec Kit (GitHub) and OpenSpec (Fission-AI) have **institutional backing**. Competing head-to-head loses.

**LeanSpec's edge:**
1. **Philosophy-first** - First principles > feature lists
2. **Agility** - No committee approval for changes
3. **AI-native from day 1** - MCP server, token optimization built-in
4. **Local-first, zero lock-in** - Trust signal for skeptics

### Open Questions

- Should we rename/rebrand to distance from "spec" category?
- Is there a niche (solo devs? specific language?) to dominate first?
- What's the activation moment that hooks users?
